    In 1992, NIIT launched its flagship program GNIIT, an industry-endorsed course with a 12-month Professional Practice
    for students seeking careers in the IT and non-IT sectors. By 1993, the NIIT stock began trading on Indian stock
    exchanges. In 1996, NIIT began its globalization journey, setting up an education center in Hong Kong. In the same
    year, the company launched its virtual university 'NetVarsity'. In 1998, NIIT joined a handful of Indian tech
    companies to enter the Chinese market. The company earned the epithet, the 'McDonald's of the software business' by
    Far Eastern Economic Review in September, 2001.[8] The same year, NIIT launched an experiment that was christened
    'Hole-in-the-Wall' by media and drew international attention. The experiment was based on the ‘minimally invasive
    education’ methodology developed by NIIT R&D. It suggested that children, irrespective of their social, ethnic, or
    educational identity could learn to use computers by themselves, without adult intervention. In 2003, NIIT launched
    its MindChampions Academy (MCA) with Viswanathan Anand, five-time former World Chess champion and NIIT Brand
    Ambassador.

    In 2004, NIIT sectioned off its software business into an independent organization called NIIT Technologies Ltd.
    (Source: NASSCOM's 2013–14 Ranking of Top 20 IT services companies). In the area of training, NIIT launched its
    'Edgeineers' program in 2005, to boost career opportunities for engineering graduates. In 2006, it diversified into
    various new sectors for training, such as banking, finance and insurance (through IFBI), executive management
    education (through NIIT Imperia brand), Professional Life Skills training and business process management training
    (through Evolv and NIIT Uniqua).
